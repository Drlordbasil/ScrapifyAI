## Usage

To use the Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Generation Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from transformers import pipeline
```

2. Instantiate the `WebScraper` class and provide a search query:

```python
search_query = "Python programming"
scraper = WebScraper(search_query)
urls = scraper.extract_urls()
```

3. Iterate over the extracted URLs and perform the content generation process:

```python
for url in urls:
    if not url.startswith("http"):
        continue

    data_extractor = DataExtractor(url)
    scraped_data = data_extractor.scrape_data()

    content_analyzer = ContentAnalyzer(scraped_data)
    analysis_result = content_analyzer.analyze_data()

    content_generator = ContentGenerator(analysis_result)
    generated_content = content_generator.generate_content()

    seo_optimizer = SEOOptimizer(generated_content)
    keywords = seo_optimizer.suggest_keywords()

    content_scheduler = ContentScheduler(generated_content)
    scheduled_time = content_scheduler.schedule_content()

    performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
    metrics = performance_tracker.track_performance()

    learning_model = LearningModel()
    learning_model.improve_generation()
```

4. Customize the code according to your specific project requirements, such as integrating with CMS or social media APIs for automated content publication.
